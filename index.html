<!-- Form :    The method tells browsers what kind of request to send. In this case, we use POST because we’re sending a POST request.    The action attribute tells the browser where to send the POST request. In this case, we’re send the POST request to /quotes. We can handle this POST request with a post method in server.js. The path path should be the value you placed in the action attribute.-->
